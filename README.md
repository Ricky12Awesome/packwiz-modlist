# Packwiz ModList

Creates a modlist from [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/)

## Rewrite
Since this project is pretty small, rewriting shouldn't be much of an issue

Why am I rewriting?

This project was made pretty quickly and not much thought when into the structure

**Goals:**
- Better error handling
- Faster build times
- Better optimized
- Better code organization / structure
- etc
